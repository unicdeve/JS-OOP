/*
  INHERITANCE allows a object to inherit another object's methods and properties
  For example, 
  Circle, Square, Triangle can inherit from a Shape Object
  The Shape object is referred to as Base/Super/Parent object
  Circle, Square are referred to as Derived/Sub/Child object

  So a Classical definition of inheritance would be IS-A, i.e 
  Circle is-a Shape, Square is-a Shape

  But in JavaScript we don't have the concept of Class, this is where Prototypical Inheritance comes in
  So in JS, we have 2 types of inheritance
  Classical and Prototypical Inheritance
