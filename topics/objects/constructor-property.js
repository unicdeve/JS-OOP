/*
  Every object in JS have a constructor property,
  and that references the function that was used to construct or create that object

  when we use object literal e.g
  let x = {}
  JS essentially does let x = new Object()

  same as other constructors like
  new String() ---but we mostly use the string literals; '', "", ``
  new Boolean --- boolean literals; true or false
  new Number() --- number literals; 0, 1, 5 etc
  new Function() --- function literals; e.g function createCircle() {}

  Functions are also objects
