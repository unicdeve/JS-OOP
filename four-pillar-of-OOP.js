  1. Encapsulation
  2. Abstraction
  3. Inheritance
  4. Polymorphism

  Before OOP, we have Procedural Programming, it's very easy straightforward
  But very difficult to manage, many inter-dependncies
  They are called Spaghetti code

  OOP combines a group of related variables and functions into a unit
  This units are called OBJECTs
  Variables are referred to as PROPERTIES and the functions as METHODs

  Example, a car object has
  properties: make, model, color, year
  methods: start, stop, move

  -ENCAPSULATION: In OOP, we group related variables and functions that operate on them into
  a objects, and this is what we call ENCAPSULATION
    **Benefits
    - Reduce complexity
    - increase reusability

  - ABSTRACTION: this is hiding most of the complexity of your objects from
  the outside world. 
    **Benefits
    - This makes the interface easier than an objects with several
    methods and properties,
    - Reduces the impact of change, because changing one part of the complex parts
      does not leak or affect other parts

  - INHERITANCE: this is a mechanism that allow us to eliminate redundant codes

  - POLYMORPHISM: Poly means Many, Morphism means Form. This helps us eliminate 
    long lines of IFs and SWITCH statement. We can have just one methods that behave
    differently depending on the value of the property
